                                            The Hitchhiker As Andrea turned off the motorway onto the road to Brockbourne, the small village in which she lived, it was four o'clock in the afternoon, but already the sun was falling behind the hills. At this time in December, it would be completely dark by five o'clock. Andrea shivered. The interior of the car was not cold, but the trees bending in the harsh wind and the patches of yesterday's snow still heaped in the fields made her feel chilly inside. It was another ten miles to the cottage where she lived with her husband Michael, and the dim light and wintry weather made her feel a little lonely. She would have liked to listen to the radio, but it had been stolen from her car when it was parked outside her office in London about two weeks ago, and she had not got around to replacing it yet. She was just coming out of the little village of Mickley when she saw the old lady, standing by the road, with a crude hand-written sign saying "Brockbourne" in her hand. Andrea was surprised. She had never seen an old lady hitchhiking before. However, the weather and the coming darkness made her feel sorry for the lady, waiting hopefully on a country road like this with little traffic. Normally, Andrea would never pick up a hitchhiker when she was alone, thinking it was too dangerous, but what was the harm in doing a favor for a little old lady like this? Andrea pulled up a little way down the road, and the lady, holding a big shopping bag, hurried over to climb in the door which Andrea had opened for her. When she did get in, Andrea could see that she was not, in fact, so little. Broad and fat, the old lady had some difficulty climbing in through the car door, with her big bag, and when she had got in, she more than filled the seat next to Andrea. She wore a long, shabby old dress, and she had a yellow hat pulled down low over her eyes. Panting noisily from her effort, she pushed her big brown canvas shopping bag down onto the floor under her feet, and said in a voice which was almost a whisper, "Thank you dearie - I'm just going to Brockbourne." Do you live there?" asked Andrea, thinking that she had never seen the old lady in the village in the four years she had lived there herself. "No, dearie," answered the passenger, in her soft voice, "I'm just going to visit a friend. He was supposed to meet me back there at Mickley, but his car won't start, so I decided to hitchhike - there isn't a bus until seven, and I didn't want to wait.

                                            The Hitchhiker As Andrea turned off the motorway onto the road to Brockbourne, the small village in which she lived, it was four o'clock in the afternoon, but already the sun was falling behind the hills. At this time in December, it would be completely dark by five o'clock. Andrea shivered. The interior of the car was not cold, but the trees bending in the harsh wind and the patches of yesterday's snow still heaped in the fields made her feel chilly inside. It was another ten miles to the cottage where she lived with her husband Michael, and the dim light and wintry weather made her feel a little lonely. She would have liked to listen to the radio, but it had been stolen from her car when it was parked outside her office in London about two weeks ago, and she had not got around to replacing it yet. She was just coming out of the little village of Mickley when she saw the old lady, standing by the road, with a crude hand-written sign saying "Brockbourne" in her hand. Andrea was surprised. She had never seen an old lady hitchhiking before. However, the weather and the coming darkness made her feel sorry for the lady, waiting hopefully on a country road like this with little traffic. Normally, Andrea would never pick up a hitchhiker when she was alone, thinking it was too dangerous, but what was the harm in doing a favor for a little old lady like this? Andrea pulled up a little way down the road, and the lady, holding a big shopping bag, hurried over to climb in the door which Andrea had opened for her. When she did get in, Andrea could see that she was not, in fact, so little. Broad and fat, the old lady had some difficulty climbing in through the car door, with her big bag, and when she had got in, she more than filled the seat next to Andrea. She wore a long, shabby old dress, and she had a yellow hat pulled down low over her eyes. Panting noisily from her effort, she pushed her big brown canvas shopping bag down onto the floor under her feet, and said in a voice which was almost a whisper, "Thank you dearie - I'm just going to Brockbourne." Do you live there?" asked Andrea, thinking that she had never seen the old lady in the village in the four years she had lived there herself. "No, dearie," answered the passenger, in her soft voice, "I'm just going to visit a friend. He was supposed to meet me back there at Mickley, but his car won't start, so I decided to hitchhike - there isn't a bus until seven, and I didn't want to wait. I knew some kind soul would give me a lift." Quetion:  Identify the phrases and clauses that modify things / persons.

                            6. The Hitchhiker As Andrea turned off the motorway onto the road to Brockbourne, the small village in which she lived, it was four o'clock in the afternoon, but already the sun was falling behind the hills. At this time in December, it would be completely dark by five o'clock. Andrea shivered. The interior of the car was not cold, but the trees bending in the harsh wind and the patches of yesterday's snow still heaped in the fields made her feel chilly inside. It was another ten miles to the cottage where she lived with her husband Michael, and the dim light and wintry weather made her feel a little lonely. She would have liked to listen to the radio, but it had been stolen from her car when it was parked outside her office in London about two weeks ago, and she had not got around to replacing it yet. She was just coming out of the little village of Mickley when she saw the old lady, standing by the road, with a crude hand-written sign saying "Brockbourne" in her hand. Andrea was surprised. She had never seen an old lady hitchhiking before. However, the weather and the coming darkness made her feel sorry for the lady, waiting hopefully on a country road like this with little traffic. Normally, Andrea would never pick up a hitchhiker when she was alone, thinking it was too dangerous, but what was the harm in doing a favor for a little old lady like this? Andrea pulled up a little way down the road, and the lady, holding a big shopping bag, hurried over to climb in the door which Andrea had opened for her. When she did get in, Andrea could see that she was not, in fact, so little. Broad and fat, the old lady had some difficulty climbing in through the car door, with her big bag, and when she had got in, she more than filled the seat next to Andrea. She wore a long, shabby old dress, and she had a yellow hat pulled down low over her eyes. Panting noisily from her effort, she pushed her big brown canvas shopping bag down onto the floor under her feet, and said in a voice which was almost a whisper, "Thank you dearie - I'm just going to Brockbourne." Do you live there?" asked Andrea, thinking that she had never seen the old lady in the village in the four years she had lived there herself. "No, dearie," answered the passenger, in her soft voice, "I'm just going to visit a friend. He was supposed to meet me back there at Mickley, but his car won't start, so I decided to hitchhike - there isn't a bus until seven, and I didn't want to wait. I knew some kind soul would give me a lift." Quetion:  Identify the phrases and clauses that modify things / persons.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Penumpang Saat Andrea mematikan jalan raya menuju Brockbourne, desa kecil tempat dia tinggal, saat itu sudah pukul empat sore, tapi matahari sudah mulai terbenam di balik perbukitan. Pada saat seperti ini di bulan Desember, hari akan benar-benar gelap pada pukul lima. Andrea menggigil. Bagian dalam mobil tidak dingin, tetapi pepohonan yang bengkok tertiup angin kencang dan tumpukan salju kemarin masih menumpuk di ladang membuatnya merasa kedinginan di dalam. Itu adalah sepuluh mil lagi ke pondok tempat dia tinggal dengan suaminya Michael, dan cahaya redup serta cuaca dingin membuatnya merasa sedikit kesepian. Dia ingin mendengarkan radio, tetapi radio itu telah dicuri dari mobilnya ketika diparkir di luar kantornya di London sekitar dua minggu yang lalu, dan dia belum sempat menggantinya. Dia baru saja keluar dari desa kecil Mickley ketika dia melihat wanita tua itu, berdiri di pinggir jalan, dengan tulisan tangan kasar bertuliskan "Brockbourne" di tangannya. Andrea terkejut. Dia belum pernah melihat seorang wanita tua menumpang sebelumnya. Namun, cuaca dan kegelapan yang akan datang membuatnya merasa kasihan pada wanita itu, menunggu semoga di jalan pedesaan seperti ini dengan sedikit lalu lintas. Biasanya, Andrea tidak akan pernah mengambil tumpangan ketika dia sendirian, karena berpikir itu terlalu berbahaya, tapi apa salahnya melakukan kebaikan untuk wanita tua kecil seperti ini? Andrea berhenti sedikit di jalan, dan wanita itu, memegang tas belanja besar, bergegas memanjat pintu yang telah dibukakan Andrea untuknya. Ketika dia benar-benar masuk, Andrea bisa melihat bahwa dia sebenarnya tidak begitu kecil. Berbadan besar dan gemuk, wanita tua itu mengalami kesulitan untuk masuk melalui pintu mobil, dengan tas besarnya, dan ketika dia masuk, dia lebih dari sekadar mengisi kursi di sebelah Andrea. Dia mengenakan gaun tua yang panjang dan lusuh, dan dia memiliki topi kuning yang menutupi matanya. Terengah-engah karena usahanya, dia mendorong tas belanja kanvas cokelatnya yang besar ke lantai di bawah kakinya, dan berkata dengan suara yang hampir seperti bisikan, "Terima kasih sayang - aku akan pergi ke Brockbourne." Apakah Anda tinggal di sana? "Tanya Andrea, berpikir bahwa dia belum pernah melihat wanita tua di desa selama empat tahun tinggal di sana sendiri." Tidak, Sayang, "jawab penumpang itu, dengan suara lembut," Saya hanya akan mengunjungi teman. Dia seharusnya menemuiku di sana di Mickley, tetapi mobilnya tidak mau menyala, jadi aku memutuskan untuk menumpang - tidak ada bus sampai pukul tujuh, dan aku tidak ingin menunggu. Saya tahu ada jiwa yang baik akan memberi saya tumpangan. "Pertanyaan: Identifikasi frasa dan klausa yang mengubah benda / orang.
