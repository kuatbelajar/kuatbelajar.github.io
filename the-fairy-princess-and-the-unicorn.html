                                            Sleeping Beauty
In a faraway kingdom, there was an empire led by a king and queen. The king led his region with a very wise and prudent. Despite being a king, their life was less happy because they did not have a child. It made the king and queen became sad.
Then one day the queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter named Princess Aurora. The birth of the little princess made the king and the entire kingdom happy. The king was making a big celebration to welcome his daughter. He invited all the people in the kingdom, including all the fairies that live in the kingdom. The king invited them to ask for their blessing. But the king forgot to invite all the fairies in the kingdom. The facts that there were 13 fairies in kingdom but the king only invited 12 fairies.
When the celebration party was running on, all of the fairies invited by king surrounded the little princess to give a blessing. One by one fairy was utter blessings. One fairy gave blessing of goodness, another fairy gave blessing of health, and the next fairy gave blessing of beautiful voice and so on. When the 12th fairy was about to give her blessing, the 13th fairy who were not invited by the king come. She was very angry and could not accept this humiliation.
The 13th fairy was not giving a blessing to the little princess, she even cursed her. The 13th fairy said, “When the baby is 16 years old, she will be pricked by a needle and fall asleep for a long time”. After saying that curse the 13th fairy left the palace using her broomstick. Everyone in the palace was shocked and saddened as well as the king and queen. The queen begged to the fairies, “Please withdraw this curse”. “What have been spoken irrevocable my queen” said the fairy. The others fairy tried to calm king and queen, “You do not worry. The princess will not die, she just fall asleep for a long time “” And this curse will be lost if there is prince who awakened her “another fairy added. Hearing the explanation, the king and queen relieved. However, they were still afraid of the incident occurred. The king ordered to get rid of all the needles in the palace.
Days passed, Princes aurora grown into a beautiful princess. She was very good and had very beautiful voice. Everyone in the palace loved her. At the age of 16, the princess entered a small room in her palace. She saw a woman who was sewing. The princess was surprised and asked, “What are you doing?”, “I’m sewing, come here I will teach you to sew” the woman replied. Princess Aurora did not know that the old woman is evil fairy in disguise. She took needle in the hands of women. Then suddenly she was pricked and fell asleep. When Princess Aurora asleep, all people in the kingdom were fell asleep too. Then the fairy put her on a mattress.
Years passed, Princess Aurora had been asleep for hundreds of years. Until the day came, a prince from a distant land approached the kingdom. He saw a beautiful princess asleep there.

                        fairy tales are tells about legend,human tradition,or folklore<br />whereas, fables are tells about fiction or just fantasy, its like the story about animal who acts like human.<br />A fable is a story, also passed down from generation to generation and it has a moral lesson to be learnt. The characters are mostly animals or nature. They are made to talk and act like humans.The most famous fables were written by a man called Aesop. Those fables are famous as Aesop’s Fables and there are around 600 of them. “Fox and the sour grapes” and “Tortoise and the hare” are two examples.<br /><br />Folk and Fairytales are stories written specially for children, often about magical characters such as elves, fairies, goblins and giants. Sometimes the characters are animals. They generally do not have any moral message to be learnt.<br /><br />semoga membantu:)<br />jadikan jawaban terbaik ya!<br />

They include fantastical and often magical beings. Fairies, witches, trolls, and the like. The list is endless. They are set in far away kingdoms and dark forests—in a time long ago, yes, but also somehow outside of time altogether.<br /><br /><br />

            Dahulu
kala, ada sepasang Raja dan Ratu yang berbahagia, karena setelah bertahun-tahun
lamanya, akhirnya Ratu melahirkan seorang Puteri. 

Raja dan Ratu mengundang tujuh
peri untuk datang dan memberkati Puteri yang baru saja lahir itu.


            Dalam
acara megah yang diselenggarakan sebagai penghormatan kepada para peri itu,
masing-masing peri memberikan berkat kepada sang Puteri.

            Peri
pertama mengatakan “Kamu akan menjadi Puteri tercantik di dunia.”Peri kedua
mengatakan “Kamu akan menjadi seorang Puteri yang periang.”Peri ketiga
mengatakan “Kamu akan selalu mendapatkan banyak kasih sayang.”Peri keempat
mengatakan “Kamu akan dapat menari dengan sangat anggun.”Peri kelima mengatakan
“Kamu akan dapat bernyanyi dengan sangat merdu.” Peri keenam mengatakan “Kamu
akan sangat pintar memainkan alat musik.”

            Tiba
- tiba datang peri tua ke tengah acara itu. Ia sangat marah karena tidak
diundang. Semua orang memang sudah lama tidak pernah melihat peri tua itu, dan
mengira bahwa ia sudah meninggal atau pergi dari kerajaan itu.

            Peri
tua yang marah itu mendekati sang Puteri dan mengutuknya “Jarimu akan tertusuk
jarum pintal dan kamu akan mati!” dan kemudian peri tua itu pun menghilang.

Semua orang sangat terkejut. Ratu
pun mulai menangis.

            Peri
ketujuh mendekati sang Puteri dan memberikan berkatnya “Aku tidak bisa
membatalkan kutukan, tapi aku dapat memberikan berkatku supaya Puteri tidak
akan mati karena terkena jarum pintal, melainkan hanya tertidur pulas selama
seratus tahun. Setelah seratus tahun, seorang Pangeran tampan akan datang untuk
membangunkannya.”

            Raja
dan Ratu merasa sedikit lega mendengarnya. Mereka lalu mengeluarkan peraturan
baru bahwa di kerajaan itu tidak boleh ada alat pintal satu pun. Mereka menyita
dan menghancurkan semua alat pintal yang ada di kerajaan itu demi selamatan
sang Puteri. Pada suatu hari disaat Puteri berusia 18 tahun, Raja dan Ratu
pergi sepanjang hari.

            Karena
kesepian, sang Puteri berjalan-jalan menjelajahi istana dan sampai di sebuah
loteng. Disana ia menjumpai seorang wanita tua yang sedang memintal benang
menggunakan alat pintal. Karena belum pernah melihat alat pintal, sang Puteri
sangat tertarik dan ingin mencoba. 

            Wanita
tua itu sebenarnya adalah peri tua jahat yang dulu mengutuknya. Saat sang
Puteri mencoba alat pintal itu, ia pun dengan sengaja menusukkan jarum pintal
ke tangan sang Puteri. 

            Sang
Puteri jatuh tak sadarkan diri dan tertidur karena terkena kutukan. Peri tua
jahat tertawa puas dan menghilang dalam kegelapan. 

            Saat
Raja dan Ratu kembali, mereka dan seluruh pegawai kerajaan kebingungan mencari
sang Puteri. Saat mereka menemukannya, Raja tersadar bahwa kutukan peri tua
jahat telah menjadi kenyataan. Sang Puteri lalu dibawa ke kamarnya dan dibaringkan
di tempat tidurnya. Raja lalu mengirimkan kabar mengenai peristiwa itu ke peri
ketujuh yang baik hati. 

Peri ketujuh yang baik hati lalu
bergegas ke istana. Ia memutuskan untuk menidurkan semua orang di kerajaan itu
supaya kelak saat kutukan sang Puteri berakhir mereka semua akan bangun
bersama-sama. 

            Dalam
waktu singkat pohon-pohon besar dan semak belukar yang lebat dan berduri tumbuh
di seluruh wilayah kerajaan, sehingga sangat sulit bagi siapapun untuk
menerobosnya. Bahkan puncak-puncak istana pun hanya dapat terlihat ujungnya
saja. Karena menjadi sangat tertutup, sang Puteri dan seluruh kerajaan menjadi
aman, walaupun mereka semua tertidur. 

            Setelah
masa seratus tahun berakhir, seorang Pangeran tampan yang kebetulan sedang
berburu di dekat wilayah kerajaan itu melihat pucuk-pucuk istana itu. Ia sudah
banyak mendengar cerita tentang kerajaan itu, antara lain tentang istana yang
dianggap berhantu, para penyihir, dan cerita-cerita lain yang sangat menyeramkan
yang sebenarnya tidak benar. 

Karena penasaran, saat kembali
dari berburu sang Pangeran mencari orang tua yang paling bijaksana dan pintar
di kerajaan untuk menanyakan tentang kerajaan tetangga yang penuh misteri itu.
